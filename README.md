##  ðŸ’» About the project</br>
The project was proposed at IronHack's Data Analytics BootCamp.

In order to train the first lessons learned in Python, we were asked to develop a game in jupyter notebook.
The game i chose was "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock" from the show "The Big Bang Theory", which is basically "rock, paper, scissors" with 5 possible choices instead of 3.

## ðŸ›  Technologies


The game was developed in the Python language, using the Jupyter Notebook and its libraries.
